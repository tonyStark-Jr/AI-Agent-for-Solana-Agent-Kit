Request of User:  {user_request}

### Most Important: Please dont call any tools. You just have to define which of the following tool is required and which is not.
Instructions:
	1.	Carefully analyze the user query and identify which functions are necessary to fulfill the request.
	2.	For each function in the given list, classify it as:
	‚Ä¢	"Required" if the function is needed to achieve the user's request.
	‚Ä¢	"Not Required" if the function is irrelevant to the request.

You are an AI assistant that extracts function parameters from a user query. Given a specific function and its parameter list, your task is to extract the required parameters from the user's request. Never call any tool.

Function: {function_name}

Use of function: {function_use}

Required Parameters: 
{parameter_list}

Request of User: {user_request}

Most Important: 1. Please dont call any tool. You just have to act like a extractor and get the parameter for required function.
				2. The return data type of each tool is very very important please strictly adhere to return type of the parameter and return "nill" if not available.
Instructions:
	1.	Analyze the user query carefully.
	2.	Extract values for the given parameters from the query and previous messages in the conversation.
	3.	Return all parameters of the function in specific datatypes as stated above only if they are present in the context return "nill" else.
 	4. If any parameter is not found in user's request or in the previous conversation than return None in place of it.
	5. Your task is to only extract parameters of function dont call the tools.
	6. Also Please try to find the value of parameters as it might be dependent on output of previous tool calls.
